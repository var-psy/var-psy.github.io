# A.1 Attractors and repulsors: Homogenization and polarization
Any process operating on Y that induces an ideal point or particularly attractive range of values can lead to concentration around that value, that is homogenization (Ostroff & Fulmer, 2014). Depending on the starting position, the induced change in Y can be positive or negative and stronger the further away the starting value is from the attractor (Figure \@ref(fig:visual-attract-repulse)a). An attractor can be an optimal value in Y under some condition X or it can only be perceived or processed as optimal if X is increasing. Depending on where the ideal is positioned relative to the starting distribution, the process can take different shapes, and the specific expected form of a conditional decrease in variability within the group might vary, for example an attractor at the border of the starting range of values will cause strong changes on the lower quantiles of a distribution but nearly none on higher quantiles (Figure \@ref(fig:visual-attract-repulse)b).

```{r visual-attract-repulse, fig.cap ="Changes in variability through attractors and repulsors", fig.topcaption = TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/FigA1.png"))
```
*Note*. Theorized individual change trajectories given (a) an attractor at the center of the distribution, (b) an attractor at the higher end of the distribution, (c) a repulsor at the center of the distribution, or (d) a repulsor at the lower end of a distribution with a floor.

Many group processes, be they explicitly coercive or directly influenced by other group members, or the normative pressure of average or authoritative perspectives, can lead to homogenization within the group due to attractors (Lang et al., 2018). Similarly, the creation of an identity and activating that identity can lead to pressure to react, think, believe, and behave similarly to others in the group or the group ideal. Also, it might matter whether (1) the ideal norm is static, (2) its change is not observed, or (3) the normative value follows additional dynamic processes (Baurne et al., 2022).

Nonetheless, we can descriptively expect a conditional decrease in variability: The more people are embedded in the group or the more strongly the identity is activated, the less variability there is. For example, an individual’s perception of the degree of their own religiousness could correspond to the strength with which the individual is pushed to conform to group norms, with more religiousness corresponding to more pressure.

While this can be a kind of conscious optimization process, this can also be more a functional theory of systemic behavior, even if the underlying mechanisms might be based on social or neural networks (either literal neurons or cognitive processes with a neural network structure) diffusion processes. If we have concrete mechanical models of the homogenization process, we might be able to derive clearer predictions of the changes in variability.

The opposite of an attractor is a repulsor, a point or range of values in Y that is particularly unattractive. If people are incentivized to avoid a specific kind of behavior, they might not change their own behavior at all if they perceive it to be very dissimilar from the disincentivized one, and react strongly if they perceive it to be similar. If changes can only go in one direction, this might lead to a reduction in variability due to asymmetric changes in the distribution (Figure \@ref(fig:visual-attract-repulse)d). This is sometimes nearly indistinguishable from the effect of an attractor on the other side of the starting distribution (Figure @ref(fig:visual-attract-repulse)b). Suppose the repulsor is close to the median of the starting distribution of values. In that case, we can expect an increase in variability and polarization, if changes in a positive and a negative direction are possible (Figure \@ref(fig:visual-attract-repulse)c). Polarization in this form would not only imply an increased variability but also a tendency towards bimodality. This is especially the case in combination with hardening dynamics, as Baumgartner et al. (2016) show. This can be understood as a combination of a global repulsor and multiple local attractors.
Figure \@ref(fig:dens-attract-repulse) shows which differences in distributions these four processes would induce in contrast to a control group. A simple simulation allows us to add some additional measurement errors.

```{r dens-attract-repulse, fig.cap ="Simulated densities for the four attraction (a, b) and repulsion (c,d) mechanisms", fig.topcaption = TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/FigA2.jpeg"))
```
*Note*. Based on 5000 simulation runs. QR estimates are based on the difference in regression coefficients for the second and third quartiles. Extreme outliers for the two-step estimator are excluded from the plot.

Specifying and implementing the mechanisms and simulating the data generation processes makes it easy to derive the hypotheses to be tested: 

(a) $V(Y|X=1) < V(Y|X = 0) \& E(Y|X=1) = E(Y|X = 0)$

(b) $V(Y|X=1) < V(Y|X = 0) \& E(Y|X=1) > E(Y|X = 0)$

(c) $V(Y|X=1) > V(Y|X = 0) \& E(Y|X=1) = E(Y|X = 0)$

(d) $V(Y|X=1) < V(Y|X = 0) \& E(Y|X=1) > E(Y|X = 0)$

In fact, we can make additional predictions: We expect a higher degree of bimodality if we have a repulsor at the center of the distribution (c) and we expect a strong increase in the lower quantiles while the upper quantiles only slightly increase if we have a repulsor at the lower end of a truncated distribution (d) as the cause of the decreased overall variance.

Of course, if these processes are observable, e.g., if we believe the increased interaction in a cohesive group induces similarity, the theorized influence process can also be tested directly. We could also design an experiment where at least the starting distribution is observed and test how the change in $Y$ depends on the starting values in $Y$. Still, analyzing the within-treatment variability can be a test of the plausibility of these assumptions before more expensive data collection is considered necessary.

# Enabling and constraining: Conditions that are necessary, sufficient, or both

This section is about the influence of a dichotomous factor on some other variable. As such, it is especially easy to apply this logic to experimental contexts, but its scope is, in principle, broader than that. If we assume that some factor is (1) involved in a process that leads to a change in a variable and (2) that this factor can be either present or absent, then the relationship can be specified in several ways that we may recognize from introductory research logic courses. The factor’s presence can be a condition for change that is necessary, sufficient, both, or neither. 

If it is necessary, we know that the change process will not happen in the absence of the factor. If it is sufficient, we know that the change process will happen in the presence of the factor. If it is both, we know that the change process will always happen in the presence of the factor and never in its absence. If it is neither, the change process may happen regardless of the factor’s presence or absence. 

At its simplest and most direct, this means that the variability of the factor’s effect on the variable is dependent on the type of relationship (Figure \@ref(fig:visual-constrain-enable)). Of course, these rather strict categorizations rarely apply directly and simply to psychological mechanisms, so circumspection should be applied when using it. Overall, if these categories apply to the factor in question somewhere along the conceptual pathway and if there are no confounding factors, the claims about relative variance should apply.

```{r visual-constrain-enable, fig.cap ="Illustration of how the type of relationship (necessary, sufficient, both, or neither) corresponds to different variances", fig.topcaption = TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/FigA3.png"))
```
*Note*. Red crosses indicate that the factor A or changes in B do not occur. Each panel shows the potential combinations if the relationship is necessary, sufficient, both or neither.

A helpful alternative to theorizing directly about sufficient conditions is thinking about constraining factors that limit the range of potential expressions. If only one value is possible when a factor is present, then that factor is a sufficient condition. Conversely, more values are possible if the factor is absent. Because of this, variability will often be lower when the factor is present. An example of necessary conditions are resources that are needed to process social cues. These resources can be cognitive or social, but if they are necessary to change $Y$, their absence constrains $Y$. Conversely, their presence enables and thus potentially increases $Y$.

When we think of probabilistic extensions of necessary and sufficient conditions, it also becomes more obvious how they can be translated to mechanisms with continuous treatments (like dose-response relationships). The simulated data sets in Figure @ref(fig:scatter-constrain-enable) include (small) random measurement noise, but most changes in the conditional variability are due to the asymmetric influence of $X$. If a higher $X$ enables changes in $Y$, $\Delta(Y)$ can become larger as $X$ increases, but it does not always increase as much as possible (Figure @ref(fig:scatter-constrain-enable)a). Complementarily, a positively restricting continuous treatment will lower the minimum value of $\Delta(Y)$ (Figure \@ref(fig:scatter-constrain-enable)b). Only a restricting and enabling treatment will produce the homoscedastic relationship often assumed in standard statistical models (Figure @ref(fig:scatter-constrain-enable)c).
```{r scatter-constrain-enable, fig.cap ="Simulated change in Y for continuous treatments (X) that are (a) enabling, (b) constraining, (c) enabling and constraining, or (d) ineffective", fig.topcaption = TRUE, echo=FALSE, results='asis', warning = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/FigA4.jpeg"))

```

Researchers should be aware that analyzing necessary conditions in this way only works if a sufficient condition is sometimes present. Or, as Braumoeller (2006) puts it, there must be enough reasons to warrant any changes in $Y$ for us to expect differences in variability under the necessary condition. The cause of changing impulses can be random, evolutionary dynamics, optimization strategies, or any of the attractors or repulsors discussed in the previous section. This could be seen as an indicator that an interactive model of necessary and sufficient conditions for the expectation would be a sensible solution (Clark et al., 2006). However, Rosenberg et al. (2017) argue convincingly that this would not demonstrate enabling or constraining, as they predict changes in the range of potential values and not (just) of the expected averages under multiple conditions, and that we need models that can test the difference in limits like quantile regression.
