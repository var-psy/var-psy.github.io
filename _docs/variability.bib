To do this, we introduce a stochastic spatial agent-based model of opinion dynamics that includes a spectrum of opinion strengths and various possible rules for how the opinion strength of one individual affects the influence that this individual has on others. Through simulations, we find that even a small amount of amplification of opinion strength through interaction with like-minded neighbors can tip the scales in favor of polarization and deadlock.},

  abstract = {The study of emergent, bottom-up, processes has long been of interest within organizational and group research. Emergent processes refer to how dynamic interactions among lower-level units (e.g. individuals) over time form a new, shared, construct or phenomena at a higher level (e.g. work group). To properly study emergence of shared constructs one needs models, and data, that both take into account variability across individuals and groups (multilevel), and variability over time (longitudinal). This article makes three contribution to the modelling and theory of of consensus emergence. First, we formulate two separate patterns of consensus emergence; homogeneous and heterogeneous. Homogeneous consensus emergence is characterized by gradual and almost deterministic adjustments of the individual trajectories, whereas heterogeneous consensus emergence show more randomly oscillating trajectories towards consensus. Second, we introduce a model-invariant statistic that measures the strength of the consensus; and allows for comparisons between different models and patterns of consensus emergence. Third, we show how Gaussian Processes can be used to further extend the consensus emergence models, allowing them to capture nonlinear dynamics, on both individual and group level, in emergent processes. Using an established data set, we show that conclusions on the pattern of consensus emergence can change depending on whether the nonlinear group mean change over time is adequately modelled or not. Thus it is crucial to correctly capture the group dynamics to properly understand the consensus emergence.},

This estimator uses generalized least squares to correct for both panel heteroskedasticity and temporally correlated errors. We argue that it is best to model dynamics via a lagged dependent variable rather than via serially correlated errors. The lagged dependent variable approach makes it easier for researchers to examine dynamics and allows for natural generalizations in a manner that the serially correlated errors approach does not. We also show that the generalized least squares correction for panel heteroskedasticity is, in general, no improvement over ordinary least squares and is, in the presence of parameter heterogeneity, inferior to it. In the conclusion we present a unified method for analyzing time-series-cross-section data.},

We then illustrate these advantages in an empirical analysis of the effect of citizens' support for democratic values at the individual level on a contextual-level outcome – the persistence of democracy – drawing on data from the World Values Survey and the Quality of Government project. Whereas we found no significant effect of support for democratic values in the model using simple group mean aggregation, citizens' support for democratic values was a significant predictor of democracies' estimated survival rate when applying latent aggregation in multilevel SEM and the two-step approach. The article corroborates previous concerns with simple aggregation and demonstrates how researchers can improve the validity of their analyses of contextual-level outcomes by using alternative strategies of aggregation.},

The proposed methodology extends to the regression setting the boxplot rule, commonly used for outlier screening with univariate data. The focus here is on bivariate settings with a single covariate, but extensions are possible. The proposal is based on quantile regression, including an additional transformation parameter for selecting the best scale for linearity of the conditional quantiles. The resulting method is used to perform effective labeling of potential outliers, with a quite low computational complexity, allowing for simple implementation within statistical software as well as commonly used spreadsheets. Some simulation experiments have been carried out to study the swamping and masking properties of the proposal. The methodology is also illustrated by some real life examples, taking as the response variable the energy consumed in the melting process. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The repercussions of such robustifying procedure on the asymptotic properties of subsequent inferential procedures are, however, underexplored. We study the effects of such a strategy on testing for heteroscedasticity. Specifically, using weighted and marked empirical processes of residuals theory, we show that the White test implemented after the outlier detection and removal is asymptotically chi-square if the underlying errors are symmetric. In a simulation study, we show that—depending on the type of outliers—the standard White test can be either severely undersized or oversized, as well as have trivial power. The statistic applied after deselecting outliers has good finite sample properties under symmetry but can suffer from size distortions under asymmetric errors. Given these results, we devise an empirical modeling strategy to guide practitioners whose preferred approach is to remove outliers from the sample.},

In their applications, the within-individual residuals are often assumed to be independent with constant variance across time, an assumption that implies that the assumed growth function fully accounts for the dependencies and patterns of variation in the data. Studies have shown that a poorly specified within-individual residual covariance structure of a linear mixed-effects model can impact the estimated covariance matrix of the random effects at the second-level, model fit and statistical inference. The consequences for nonlinear mixed-effects models are not, however, clearly understood. This is due in part to the differences in the estimation needs of the two types of models. Using empirical data examples, this work illustrates the impact of fitting alternative residual covariance structures in nonlinear mixed-effects models that do not entirely parallel the results from studies of strictly linear mixed-effects models and call for the need of researchers to consider alternative structures when fitting nonlinear mixed-effects models.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the theoretical, pragmatic, and substantive factors that have hampered the integration between psychology and psychometrics. Theoretical factors include the operationalist mode of thinking which is common throughout psychology, the dominance of classical test theory, and the use of “construct validity” as a catch-all category for a range of challenging psychometric problems. Pragmatic factors include the lack of interest in mathematically precise thinking in psychology, inadequate representation of psychometric modeling in major statistics programs, and insufficient mathematical training in the psychological curriculum. Substantive factors relate to the absence of psychological theories that are sufficiently strong to motivate the structure of psychometric models. Following the identification of these problems, a number of promising recent developments are discussed, and suggestions are made to further the integration of psychology and psychometrics.},

  abstract = {English The author compares religious and moral values of three generations in Scandinavia, starting from the question: is it true that young people lack moral principles and have low moral standards compared with older generations? The assumed moral decay in society is often blamed on the young generation. The empirical evidence of the RAMP survey (Religious and Moral Pluralism) does not support this hypothesis. Young people are, however, to a large extent guided by other moral principles than the older generations. While young people often stress the consequences of their moral actions, the older generations emphasize the existence of general rules about right and wrong. This indicates that the young and the older generations approach moral issues in quite different ways. Our material is taken from the RAMP survey conducted in the four Scandinavian countries from 1998 to 1999. RAMP has made it possible for researchers to study the relationships between religiosity and morality in new ways compared to the European Values Studies. French L'auteur compare les valeurs religieuses et morales de trois générations différentes en Scandinavie. Son point de départ est la question de savoir s'il est vrai que les jeunes manquent de principes moraux et mènent une vie moins morale que les générations plus âgées. Cette hypothèse est démentie par la recherche empirique RAMP (Religious and Moral Pluralism) qui montre que les jeunes sont à l'évidence largement guidés par des principes moraux mais que ceux-ci sont autres que ceux des générations précédentes. Tandis que les jeunes insistent souvent sur les conséquences de leurs actions morales, les plus âgés mettent davantage l'accent sur des règles générales concernant le bien et le mal. Il ressort aussi que les jeunes et les plus âgés approchent les questions morales de faç on assez différente. Ce matériau est tiré de la recherche RAMP qui a été réalisée dans les quatre pays scandinaves en 1998-1999. Elle a permis aux chercheurs de revisiter les rapports entre attitudes religieuses et attitudes morales au regard des Etudes des Valeurs Européennes.},

This article points out that some causal relationships produce changes in the variance, not the mean, of that distribution. It makes the case for variance-altering causation by demonstrating its empirical relevance to political scientists. The article also lays out an array of causal mechanisms—under the general headings of aggregation, contagion, and constraint—in order to demonstrate the logical coherence of variance-altering causation and the many ways in which it can arise. The discussion highlights the often-stringent empirical and logical requirements that must be met if the researcher hopes to make concrete predictions about changes in variance.},

We show how this correlation can be derived from the parameters of NLPMs, develop tests for the statistical significance of the derived correlation, and illustrate its usefulness in two applications. Under certain circumstances, which we explain, the derived correlation provides a way of overcoming the problems inherent in cross-sample comparisons of the parameters of NLPMs.},

Typically, all the factors that affect ecological processes are not measured and included in the statistical models used to investigate relationships between variables associated with those processes. As a consequence, there may be a weak or no predictive relationship between the mean of the response variable (y) distribution and the measured predictive factors (X). Yet there may be stronger, useful predictive relationships with other parts of the response variable distribution. This primer relates quantile regression estimates to prediction intervals in parametric error distribution regression models (eg least squares), and discusses the ordering characteristics, interval nature, sampling variation, weighting, and interpretation of the estimates for homogeneous and heterogeneous regression models.},

When both outliers and heteroscedasticity exist, the inflation of the scale’s estimate can deteriorate. Using graphical analysis, this study identifies outliers under heteroscedastic error without specifying a functional form. A jigsaw plot with two kinds of cut-off points differentiates both outlying and heteroscedastic characteristics for each observation in the data. The proposed approach is based on the concept of the weighted least absolute deviation estimator. Furthermore, plugging the resulting residuals into the estimation of the heteroscedasticity-consistent covariance matrix leads to a robust quasi-t test for the estimated coefficients.},

We then demonstrate how this proposed heuristic can provide a unified account for a broad set of findings spanning areas of research that might at first appear unrelated (e.g., system justification, nominal realism, is–ought errors in moral reasoning). By revealing the deep commonalities among the diverse phenomena that fall under its scope, our account is able to generate new insights into these phenomena, as well as new empirical predictions. A second main goal of this article, aside from introducing the inherence heuristic, is to articulate the proposal that the heuristic serves as a foundation for the development of psychological essentialism. More specifically, we propose that               essentialism               ~–~which is the common belief that natural and social categories are underlain by hidden, causally powerful essences~–~emerges over the first few years of life as an elaboration of the earlier, and more open-ended, intuitions supplied by the inherence heuristic. In the final part of the report, we distinguish our proposal from competing accounts (e.g., Strevens's K-laws) and clarify the relationship between the inherence heuristic and related cognitive tendencies (e.g., the correspondence bias). In sum, this article illuminates a basic cognitive process that emerges early in life and is likely to have profound effects on many aspects of human psychology.},

An equally important issue is identifying factors that contribute to more or less accurate predictions. The time series literature includes well developed methods for studying predictability and volatility over time. This article develops distribution-appropriate methods for studying individual differences in predictability for settings in psychological research. Specifically, 3 different approaches are discussed for modeling predictability. The 1st is a bivariate measure of predictability discussed previously in the psychology literature, the squared or absolute valued difference between criterion and predictor, which is shown to follow the gamma distribution. The 2nd method extended limitations of previous research and involved understanding predictability in regression models. The 3rd method used nonlinear multilevel models to study predictability in settings where participants are nested within clusters. An application was presented using SAS NLMIXED to understand the predictability of college grade point average by student demographic characteristics. The findings from the application suggest that the 1st-year college performance of English as a second language students were, on average, less predictable whereas females and Whites tended to demonstrate more predictable academic performance than their male or racial/ethnic minority counterparts.},

Ganz im Gegensatz zu der Fülle theoretischer Abhandlungen ist die Anzahl empirisch ausgerichteter Beiträge, die sich systematisch und damit nicht nur exemplarisch anhand von Einzelfällen mit der Frage interkultureller moralischer Unterschiede bzw. Gemeinsamkeiten auseinandersetzt, doch eher bescheiden. Diese Feststellung gilt insbesondere für quantitativ ausgerichtete Arbeiten. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Untersuchung besteht in erster Linie darin, anhand der kombinierten Europäischen und Weltwertestudie zu analysieren, inwieweit sich für ausgewählte Themenbereiche bedeutende kulturelle Eigenheiten nachweisen lassen, die sich nicht auf systematische und damit theoretisch zu erwartende Unterschiede zwischen den Befragten oder den einzelnen Ländern zurückführen lassen. Mit der vorliegenden Untersuchung soll somit ein Beitrag dazu geleistet werden, bestehende empirische Forschungslücken zu verringern. (Autorenreferat)},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to examine the relations between the mean difference and the mean deviation with reference to the main continuous distribution models. At present, the analytical expressions of the mean difference, in a more or less compact form, have been developed for almost all the continuous distribution models. The numerical calculation of the mean difference is, instead, always possible for any distribution model. The distribution models without the shape parameters, those with only one shape parameter and those with two shape parameters have been considered. The perfect rank correlation between the values of the two indexes for the models without shape parameters have been ensured. In the case of models with only one shape parameter, it has been observed that, when the shape parameter changes, the two indexes are both increasing or both decreasing, so that the relation between the same is growing. The relation between the two indexes has allowed detection of the intervals in which one index is greater than the other and that in which it is less. Similar findings emerged when dealing with models with two shape parameters determining the region in which one index is greater than the other and as well as the complementary one.},

Our definition produces residuals that are exactly normal, apart from sampling variability in the estimated parameters, by inverting the fitted distribution function for each response value and finding the equivalent standard normal quantile. Our definition includes some randomization to achieve continuous residuals when the response variable is discrete. Quantile residuals are easily computed in computer packages such as SAS, S-Plus, GLIM, or LispStat, and allow residual analyses to be carried out in many commonly occurring situations in which the customary definitions of residuals fail. Quantile residuals are applied in this article to three example data sets.}

  abstract = {Traditional econometric models assume a constant one-period forecast variance. To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.}

We show that this macro-level implication of network structure depends on hidden micro-level assumptions. Using a computational model similar to earlier studies, we find that ties between clusters facilitate cultural convergence under the micro-level assumptions of assimilation and attraction to similar others. However, these assumptions also have negative counterparts—differentiation and xenophobia. We found that when these negative possibilities are no longer assumed away, the effect of long-range ties reverses: Even very small amounts of contact between highly clustered communities sharply increased polarization at the population level.

Why do we observe variation in free-riding behavior? This study addresses this question by examining contributions to an important international public good—collective defense in military alliances. It develops a behavioral theory of free-riding in which the beliefs of world leaders are important for explaining investments in public goods. The argument holds that leaders with business experience make smaller contributions to collective defense because they are egoistic and more comfortable relying on a powerful ally for their defense. An analysis of defense expenditures in 17 non-U.S. members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization from 1952 to 2014 provides evidence consistent with the theory. The findings suggest that leaders with business experience are more likely than other heads of government to act as self-interested utility maximizers.},

This paper shows that the standard Gini index underestimates the rate of increase in inequality because a shift of income towards the top incomes increases both its numerator and denominator. A modified index (G2), obtain by replacing the mean in the denominator by the median indicates that income inequality in the United States grew at double the rate of the Gini index from 1967 to 2011. The analysis adjusts for the effect of the changes made to the survey in 1994. The index G2 is readily computed from the mean, median and Gini index, routinely published by the U.S. Census Bureau and other national statistical agencies. While other indices give greater weight to the upper end of the income distribution, they must be calculated from micro-data. The large sample properties of the empirical estimator of G2 are obtained.  While the limitations of the index G2 for some analytic purposes are noted, it is an easily calculated summary descriptive measure that is more sensitive to important changes in the income distribution than the Gini index.},

  abstract = {Dependent data arise in many studies. Frequently adopted sampling designs, such as cluster, multilevel, spatial, and repeated measures, may induce this dependence, which the analysis of the data needs to take into due account. In a previous publication (Geraci and Bottai in Biostatistics 8:140–154, 2007), we proposed a conditional quantile regression model for continuous responses where subject-specific random intercepts were included to account for within-subject dependence in the context of longitudinal data analysis. The approach hinged upon the link existing between the minimization of weighted absolute deviations, typically used in quantile regression, and the maximization of a Laplace likelihood. Here, we consider an extension of those models to more complex dependence structures in the data, which are modeled by including multiple random effects in the linear conditional quantile functions. We also discuss estimation strategies to reduce the computational burden and inefficiency associated with the Monte Carlo EM algorithm we have proposed previously. In particular, the estimation of the fixed regression coefficients and of the random effects’ covariance matrix is based on a combination of Gaussian quadrature approximations and non-smooth optimization algorithms. Finally, a simulation study and a number of applications of our models are presented.},

  abstract = {The study attempts to examine the symmetric and the asymmetric impact of volatility of economic growth on the inequality of income in the major ASEAN economies over the period 1980–2015. Financial development, trade openness as a proxy of globalization, inflation, human capital formation, and fiscal policy are utilized as major control variables. The paper tries to explore the causal association between inequality of income distribution and economic growth volatility, exploring simultaneously the long-run association and the short-run dynamics in the time series structure. The study applied Clemente–Montanes–Reyes unit root test to identify the structural break in the time series. Further, the cointegrating relationship of the time series observations was explored by applying the ARDL (linear) bounds test approach along with the nonlinear ARDL for making fruitful comparisons in the long-run relationship among the variables. The countries chosen are Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore and The Philippines. The empirical findings strongly suggest a long-run cointegrating relationship between income inequality and growth volatility with a positive and statistically significant impact. Also, the causality analysis was explored using the Toda and Yamamoto (1995) method of Granger causality. The causality test shows that there exists bidirectional causality from inequality transmission to economic growth volatility. The implications that are developed from this study helps us to understand the various policy reforms in the ASEAN region, that are more transparent and can make these economies less susceptible to risks.},

Our aim in this article is to develop software for this distribution for the R programming environment. We develop fast, reliable basic probability functions (dinvgauss, pinvgauss, qinvgauss and rinvgauss) that work for all possible parameter values and which achieve close to full machine accuracy. The most challenging task is to compute quantiles for given cumulative probabilities and we develop a simple but elegant mathematical solution to this problem. We show that Newton’s method for finding the quantiles of a IGD always converges monotonically when started from the mode of the distribution. Simple Taylor series expansions are used to improve accuracy on the log-scale. The IGD probability functions provide the same options and obey the same conventions as do probability functions provided in the standard R stats package. The IGD functions are part of the statmod package available from the CRAN repository.},

The continuous distribution models without shape parameters, those with only one shape parameter, and those with two shape parameters have been considered. The shape parameters encountered are inequality indexes, skewness indexes or kurtosis indexes. For the models without shape parameters the perfect equal ranking of the values of the two indexes have been verified. For the models with only one shape parameter it was seen that with variations in the shape parameter both indexes increase or decrease, so that the relation between them is growing. The ratio between the two indexes made it possible to determine the interval in which one index is greater than the other and the one in which it is less. Analogous results emerged for the models with two shape parameters, in particular the region in which one index is greater than the other and the complementary one. It was confirmed that for some models the mean difference has a wider field of definition in terms of the parameters than the standard deviation.},

Denoting the O.L.S. residuals by {$<$}tex-math{$>\$\backslash$}|\textbackslash hat u\textbackslash |\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$}, one obtains, for instance, a regression like {$<$}tex-math{$>\$\backslash$}|\textbackslash hat u\textbackslash | = a + bz + \textbackslash hat \textbackslash epsilon\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$} where z is a variable, a and b regression coefficients and {$<$}tex-math{$>\$\backslash$}hat \textbackslash epsilon\${$<$}/tex-math{$>$} the residuals of the new regression. We call the acceptance of a non-zero value for both a and b a case of "mixed heteroskedasticity", which we deem frequent in practice though neglected in handbooks. The paper also summarizes another test due to S. M. Goldfeld and R. E. Quandt and examines the powers of the two by using Monte-Carlo simulations: the new test seems to compare favourably, except perhaps in the case of large samples.}

Of particular interest are ceiling or floor lines. For example, many theories use terms such as veto player, constraint, only if, and so on, which suggest ceilings. Ceiling hypotheses have a nonstandard form claiming the probability of Y~will be zero for all values of Y~greater than the ceiling value of Yc for a given value of X. Conversely, ceiling hypotheses make no specific prediction about the value of Y for a given value of X~except that it will be less than the ceiling value. Floors work by guaranteeing minimum levels. The article gives numerous examples of theories that imply ceiling or floor hypotheses and numerous examples of data that fit such hypotheses. The article proposes quantile regression as a means of estimating the boundaries of the no-data zone as well as criteria for evaluating the importance of the boundary variable. These techniques are illustrated for ceiling and floor hypotheses relating gross domestic product/capita and democracy.},

But political scientists are often interested in how effects vary across subpopulations—heterogeneous treatment effects—and how differences in the content of the treatment affects responses—the response to heterogeneous treatments. Several new methods have been introduced to estimate heterogeneous effects, but it is difficult to know if a method will perform well for a particular data set. Rather than using only one method, we show how an ensemble of methods—weighted averages of estimates from individual models increasingly used in machine learning—accurately measure heterogeneous effects. Building on a large literature on ensemble methods, we show how the weighting of methods can contribute to accurate estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects and demonstrate how pooling models lead to superior performance to individual methods across diverse problems. We apply the ensemble method to two experiments, illuminating how the ensemble method for heterogeneous treatment effects facilitates exploratory analysis of treatment effects.},

We argue that one of the most divisive factors in psychological science is whether researchers choose to use computational modeling of theories (over and above data) during the scientific-inference process. Modeling is undervalued yet holds promise for advancing psychological science. The inherent demands of computational modeling guide us toward better science by forcing us to conceptually analyze, specify, and formalize intuitions that otherwise remain unexamined—what we dub open theory. Constraining our inference process through modeling enables us to build explanatory and predictive theories. Here, we present scientific inference in psychology as a path function in which each step shapes the next. Computational modeling can constrain these steps, thus advancing scientific inference over and above the stewardship of experimental practice (e.g., preregistration). If psychology continues to eschew computational modeling, we predict more replicability crises and persistent failure at coherent theory building. This is because without formal modeling we lack open and transparent theorizing. We also explain how to formalize, specify, and implement a computational model, emphasizing that the advantages of modeling can be achieved by anyone with benefit to all.},

  abstract = {Model comparison in Bayesian mixed models is becoming popular in psychological science. Here we develop a set of nested models that account for order restrictions across individuals in psychological tasks. An order-restricted model addresses the question "Does everybody," as in "Does everybody show the usual Stroop effect," or "Does everybody respond more quickly to intense noises than subtle ones?" The crux of the modeling is the instantiation of 10s or 100s of order restrictions simultaneously, one for each participant. To our knowledge, the problem is intractable in frequentist contexts but relatively straightforward in Bayesian ones. We develop a Bayes factor model-comparison strategy using Zellner and Siow's default g-priors appropriate for assessing whether effects obey equality and order restrictions. We apply the methodology to seven data sets from Stroop, Simon, and Eriksen interference tasks. Not too surprisingly, we find that everybody Stroops-that is, for all people congruent colors are truly named more quickly than incongruent ones. But, perhaps surprisingly, we find these order constraints are violated for some people in the Simon task, that is, for these people spatially incongruent responses occur truly more quickly than congruent ones! Implications of the modeling and conjectures about the task-related differences are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record},

  abstract = {A prevailing notion in experimental psychology is that individuals’ performance in a task varies gradually in a continuous fashion. In a Stroop task, for example, the true average effect may be 50 ms with a standard deviation of say 30 ms. In this case, some individuals will have greater effects than 50 ms, some will have smaller, and some are forecasted to have negative effects in sign—they respond faster to incongruent items than to congruent ones! But are there people who have a true negative effect in Stroop or any other task? We highlight three qualitatively different effects: negative effects, null effects, and positive effects. The main goal of this paper is to develop models that allow researchers to explore whether all three are present in a task: Do all individuals show a positive effect? Are there individuals with truly no effect? Are there any individuals with negative effects? We develop a family of Bayesian hierarchical models that capture a variety of these constraints. We apply this approach to Stroop interference experiments and a near-liminal priming experiment where the prime may be below and above threshold for different people. We show that most tasks people are quite alike—for example everyone has positive Stroop effects and nobody fails to Stroop or Stroops negatively. We also show a case that under very specific circumstances, we could entice some people to not Stroop at all.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers – often implicitly – assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these “standard subjects” are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species – frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior – hence, there are no obvious               a priori               grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of               human               nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

Using examples from both clustered and longitudinal designs, we then address issues of centering for observed predictor variables: its use in creating interpretable fixed and random effects of predictors, its relationship to endogeneity problems (correlations between predictors and model error terms), and its translation into multivariate multilevel models (using latent-centering within multilevel structural equation models). Finally, we describe novel extensions—mixedeffects location–scale models—designed for predicting differential amounts of variability.},

In this study, we systematically review the scholarship that underpins the utilities of OR and EGINI and evaluate their properties across four research scenarios of allocating newly created opportunities under educational expansion. Formal analyses suggest that (1) both OR and EGINI monotonically increase (decrease) if the newly created educational positions are entirely delivered to the upper (lower) class. However, the rate of change differs between OR and EGINI. (2) When educational opportunities within expansion are allocated according to the relative populations of social classes, the probabilities of upper and lower classes to receive better education rise by the same extent, suggesting that all social classes benefit from the proliferation of educational credentials. This would drive down the EGINI, but change in OR is not monotonic. (3) EGINI remains unchanged if the newly created educational opportunities are allocated based on the initial class composition of better educated individuals before educational expansion. However, OR is driven to increase by the “Matthew Effect” where the increment in educational probability for the upper class is larger than that for the lower class. The discrepancy of empirical patterns between OR and EGINI is explained, and the practical implications are discussed using a case study of the educational policy evaluation in Britain.},

We particularly focus on the least weighted squares estimator, for which we review its properties and propose new weighting schemes together with corresponding estimates for the variance of disturbances. An illustrative example revealing the idea of the estimator to down-weight individual measurements is presented. Further, two numerical simulations presented here allow to compare various estimators. They verify the theoretical results for the least weighted squares to be meaningful. MM-estimators turn out to yield the best results in the simulations in terms of both accuracy and precision. The least weighted squares (with suitable weights) remain only slightly behind in terms of the mean square error and are able to outperform the much more popular least trimmed squares estimator, especially for smaller sample sizes.},

  abstract = {National Board of Health and Welfare claims that the quality of elderly care services differ considerably between municipalities in Sweden. This study aims to analyze to what extent these variations can be accounted for by the older person’s municipality affiliation (i.e. receiving elderly care in a certain municipality).,Addressing this issue, national survey data from 78,538 older respondents receiving elderly care services in Sweden were analyzed using multilevel modeling (MLM).,The results showed that municipality affiliation only marginally explained the variance in satisfaction with care, i.e. its variations were larger within than between municipalities. Instead, user-oriented care accounted for the variation in satisfaction with care. Specifically, the way the care workers behave toward the older person proved to be much more crucial for satisfaction with care than municipality affiliation. Moreover, random effects analyses revealed that the effects of user-oriented care on satisfaction with care varied across municipalities. Care setting (i.e. home care or nursing home) only marginally accounted for its variance.,Developing care quality should start and primarily be discussed at the interpersonal care level, and not, as is customary, at the municipality level.,The present research is the first in its kind to quantitatively investigate the sources of variation in perceived quality of Swedish elderly care using MLM.},

We discuss its distinction from unconditional quantile regression, an analytic method that can be used to estimate varying associations between predictors and outcome at different points of the outcome distribution. We argue that the research question posed by Budig and Hodges (2010)—whether the motherhood penalty is larger for low-wage women—cannot be answered with the authors’ conditional quantile regression models. Using more appropriate unconditional quantile regression models, we find, in contrast to Budig and Hodges’s claims, that the motherhood penalty is not largest for low-wage women.},

Although the field has experienced rapid growth, conceptual and methodological challenges remain. We begin by discussing two major unresolved methodological concerns facing wealth research: how to address challenges to causal inference posed by wealth’s cumulative nature and how to operationalize net worth given its highly skewed distribution. Next, we provide an overview of data sources available for wealth research. To underscore the need for continued empirical attention to net worth, we review trends in wealth levels and inequality and evaluate wealth’s distinctiveness as an indicator of social stratification. We then review recent empirical evidence on the effects of wealth on other social outcomes, as well as research on the determinants of wealth. We close with a list of promising avenues for future research on wealth, its causes, and its consequences.},

  abstract = {“Robust standard errors” are used in a vast array of scholarship to correct standard errors for model misspecification. However, when misspecification is bad enough to make classical and robust standard errors diverge, assuming that it is nevertheless not so bad as to bias everything else requires considerable optimism. And even if the optimism is warranted, settling for a misspecified model, with or without robust standard errors, will still bias estimators of all but a few quantities of interest. The resulting cavernous gap between theory and practice suggests that considerable gains in applied statistics may be possible. We seek to help researchers realize these gains via a more productive way to understand and use robust standard errors; a new general and easier-to-use “generalized information matrix test” statistic that can formally assess misspecification (based on differences between robust and classical variance estimates); and practical illustrations via simulations and real examples from published research. How robust standard errors are used needs to change, but instead of jettisoning this popular tool we show how to use it to provide effective clues about model misspecification, likely biases, and a guide to considerably more reliable, and defensible, inferences. Accompanying this article is software that implements the methods we describe.},

  abstract = {Given a scalar random variable Y and a random vector X defined on the same probability space, the conditional distribution of Y given X can be represented by either the conditional distribution function or the conditional quantile function. To these equivalent representations correspond two alternative approaches to estimation. One approach, distributional regression (DR), is based on direct estimation of the conditional distribution function; the other approach, quantile regression (QR), is instead based on direct estimation of the conditional quantile function. Indirect estimates of the conditional quantile function and the conditional distribution function may then be obtained by inverting the direct estimates obtained from either approach. Despite the growing attention to the DR approach, and the vast literature on the QR approach, the link between the two approaches has not been explored in detail. The aim of this paper is to fill-in this gap by providing a better understanding of the relative performance of the two approaches, both asymptotically and in finite samples, under the linear location model and certain types of heteroskedastic location-scale models.},

  abstract = {Using mathematical models of human cognition has become an increasingly important and valuable research tool in many different fields of psychological research and neighboring areas. Widely used are drift diffusion models (DDMs) that can be used to predict probability density functions (PDFs) of binary choice reaction tasks. Often, the parameters of such a model are time-independent (i.e., they do not vary as a function of time within a trial). However, the more general case is that of time-dependent parameters. Several recent models, for example, assume time-dependency for the drift rate and/or the boundaries. Such time-dependent (or non-stationary) models increase mathematical complexity, but several solutions to approximate the PDFs have been advanced. We here present dRiftDM, an R package particularly designed to meet the needs of psychological research. This package approximates the PDFs by solving the Kolmogorov-Forward-Equation to handle time-dependent models as well. Fitting a model to data can be done participant-wise, and model parameters and statistics are easily accessible and can be visualized directly to provide information about (qualitative) model fits. Hands-on examples for using pre-built models and for developing own models are provided.},

We extend this notion to include so-called inconsistently connected systems, in which the measurements of a given property in different contexts may have different distributions, due to contextual biases in experimental design or physical interactions (signaling): a system of measurements has a maximally noncontextual description if they can be imposed a joint distribution on in which the measurements of any one property in different contexts are equal to each other with the maximal probability allowed by their different distributions. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a description in a broad class of systems including Klyachko-Can-Binicioğlu-Shumvosky-type (KCBS), EPR-Bell-type, and Leggett-Garg-type systems. Because these conditions allow for inconsistent connectedness, they are applicable to real experiments. We illustrate this by analyzing an experiment by Lapkiewicz and colleagues aimed at testing contextuality in a KCBS-type system.},

An important example of such a situation in social psychology is consensus: the fact that people are more similar to each other in certain conditions. Currently, methods to assess differences in consensus (or variability in general) are not very well-developed or widely known. We describe an existing tool that allows testing the extent to which variability depends on one or several predictor variables. We explain how multilevel modelling's capacity to model heterogeneity in residual variance can be used to test substantive hypotheses about differences in variance. We illustrate the procedure and warn against potential misuses of multilevel modelling to analyse differences in variability.

  abstract = {Abstract Organizational researchers have long been interested in studying bottom-up multilevel processes where lower level units (e.g., employees) in organizations interact to jointly create characteristics of higher level units (e.g., work groups). This article contributes to the literature on bottom-up processes by detailing a statistical approach?the consensus emergence model (CEM)?that allows researchers to study emergence of shared perceptions and feelings or climates in groups over time. The described methodological approach extends standard multilevel methodology by examining residual variances within a growth model to account for dynamic change in group consensus. The CEM provides a formal test for consensus emergence. The approach also allows researchers to test explanatory models of consensus emergence by including person-level, group-level, and observation-level predictors. We illustrate the CEM by applying the method to data from two longitudinal studies of work units. The first study investigated job satisfaction in military companies. Our second study examined professional archeologists working in groups on a field excavation mission and focused on fatigue at the end of the work day. Our analyses demonstrate the CEM's ability to detect and study emergence, and suggest that the CEM may be a valuable tool to help extend the study of emergence in organizational research.},

  abstract = {Ideal point estimators are typically based on an assumption that all legislators are equally responsive to modeled dimensions of legislative disagreement; however, particularistic constituency interests and idiosyncrasies of individual legislators introduce variation in the degree to which legislators cast votes predictably. I introduce a Bayesian heteroskedastic ideal point estimator and demonstrate by Monte Carlo simulation that it outperforms standard homoskedastic estimators at recovering the relative positions of legislators. In addition to providing a refinement of ideal point estimates, the heteroskedastic estimator recovers legislator-specific error variance parameters that describe the extent to which each legislator's voting behavior is               not               conditioned on the primary axes of disagreement in the legislature. Through applications to the roll call histories of the U.S. Congress, the E.U. Parliament, and the U.N.

  abstract = {My first reaction to "The Credibility Revolution in Empirical Economics," authored by Joshua D. Angrist and Jörn-Steffen Pischke, was: Wow! This paper makes a stunningly good case for relying on purposefully randomized or accidentally randomized experiments to relieve the doubts that afflict inferences from nonexperimental data. On further reflection, I realized that I may have been overcome with irrational exuberance. Moreover, with this great honor bestowed on my "con" article, I couldn't easily throw this child of mine overboard. As Angrist and Pischke persuasively argue, either purposefully randomized experiments or accidentally randomized "natural" experiments can be extremely helpful, but Angrist and Pischke seem to me to overstate the potential benefits of the approach. I begin with some thoughts about the inevitable limits of randomization, and the need for sensitivity analysis in this area, as in all areas of applied empirical work. I argue that the recent financial catastrophe is a powerful illustration of the fact that extrapolating from natural experiments will inevitably be hazardous. I discuss how the difficulties of applied econometric work cannot be evaded with econometric innovations, offering as examples some under-recognized difficulties with instrumental variables and robust standard errors. I conclude with comments about the shortcomings of an experimentalist paradigm as applied to macroeconomics, and some warnings about the willingness of applied economists to apply push-button methodologies without sufficient hard thought regarding their applicability and shortcomings.},

Heteroscedasticity between clusters can be modelled by introducing random effects in the dispersion model, as is heterogeneity between clusters in the mean model. This class will, among other things, enable models with heavy-tailed distributions to be explored, providing robust estimation against outliers. The h-likelihood provides a unified framework for this new class of models and gives a single algorithm for fitting all members of the class. This algorithm does not require quadrature or prior probabilities.},

They are valid in cases where the parameters of different distributions may be unequal but are thought a priori to be related in certain ways. A log-linear model is assumed for the variances, together with a linear model for the means. Some general Bayesian results are obtained, and some special cases are discussed including the important situation where parameters of different distributions are a priori exchangeable. The posterior estimates then adjust the standard estimates, by shrinking them towards central values based on collateral information. A numerical example concerns the simultaneous estimation of the variances of the observed breaking strengths of six fabrics.}

  abstract = {Constructs that reflect differences in variability are of interest to many researchers studying workplace phenomena. The aggregation methods typically used to investigate “variability-based” constructs suffer from several limitations, including the inability to include Level 1 predictors and a failure to account for uncertainty in the variability estimates. We demonstrate how mixed-effects location-scale (MELS) and heterogeneous variance models, which are direct extensions of traditional mixed-effects (or multilevel) models, can be used to test mean (location)- and variability (scale)-related hypotheses simultaneously. The aims of this article are to demonstrate (a) how the MELS and heterogeneous variance models can be estimated with both nested cross-sectional and longitudinal data to answer novel research questions about constructs of interest to organizational researchers, (b) how a Bayesian approach allows for the inclusion of random intercepts and slopes when predicting both variability and mean levels, and finally (c) how researchers can use a multilevel approach to predict between-group heterogeneous variances. In doing so, this article highlights the added value of viewing variability as more than a statistical nuisance in organizational research.},

This article begins with evidence of systematic anomalies in the empirical joint distribution of height-weight data and follows with a hypothesis that explains these anomalies in terms of a theoretical joint distribution relative to a linear equation. The hypothesis has serious consequences because even in traditional examples, while it offers an improved fit to the data, its estimates of the linear center do not correspond to traditional least squares estimates of the linear relation for the same two variables.},

  abstract = {In political science, data with heterogeneous units are used in many studies, such as those involving legislative proposals in different policy areas, electoral choices by different types of voters, and government formation in varying party systems. To disentangle decision-making mechanisms by units, traditional discrete choice models focus exclusively on the conditional mean and ignore the heterogeneous effects within a population. This paper proposes a conditional binary quantile model that goes beyond this limitation to analyze discrete response data with varying alternative-specific features. This model offers an in-depth understanding of the relationship between the explanatory and response variables. Compared to conditional mean-based models, the conditional binary quantile model relies on weak distributional assumptions and is more robust to distributional misspecification. The model also relaxes the assumption of the independence of irrelevant alternatives, which is often violated in practice. The method is applied to a range of political studies to show the heterogeneous effects of explanatory variables across the conditional distribution. Substantive interpretations from counterfactual scenarios are used to illustrate how the conditional binary quantile model captures unobserved heterogeneity, which extant models fail to do. The results point to the risk of averaging out the heterogeneous effects across units by conditional mean-based models.},

In this review, we provide an overview of the key ideas and terminology of Bayesian statistics, and we discuss articles in the top journals that have used or developed Bayesian methods over the last decade. In this process, we elucidate some of the advantages of the Bayesian approach. We highlight that many sociologists are, in fact, using Bayesian methods, even if they do not realize it, because techniques deployed by popular software packages often involve Bayesian logic and/or computation.

Furthermore, four score tests are examined which contain Breusch and Pagan's score test and its Studentized version (Koenker's score test), Verbyla's score test and the White score test which has been adopted by the SAS Institute. For nornal errors, Monte Carlo results show that Verbyla's residual likelihood ratio test holds its null size well and is more powerful than other tests.

In addition, Breusch and Pagan's and Verbyla's score tests are robust against high leverages. Finally, Monte Carlo studies show that Koenker's test outperforms White's test and should be used routinely in place of White's test. An example is presented to illustrate the test statistics.},

The method is based on the estimation of marginal wage distributions consistent with a conditional distribution estimated by quantile regression as well as with any hypothesized distribution for the covariates. Comparing the marginal distributions implied by different distributions for the covariates, one is then able to perform counterfactual exercises. The proposed methodology enables the identification of the sources of the increased wage inequality observed in most countries. Specifically, it decomposes the changes in the wage distribution over a period of time into several factors contributing to those changes, namely by discriminating between changes in the characteristics of the working population and changes in the returns to these characteristics. We apply this methodology to Portuguese data for the period 1986–1995, and find that the observed increase in educational levels contributed decisively towards greater wage inequality.

The method is based on the estimation of the conditional distribution by quantile regression. The conditional distribution is then integrated over the range of covariates. Counterfactual distributions can be estimated, allowing the decomposition of changes in distribution into three factors: coefficients, covariates and residuals. Sources of changes in wage inequality in the USA between 1973 and 1989 are examined. Unlike most of the literature, we find that residuals account for only 20\% of the explosion of inequality in the 80s.},

In response to the perceived crisis, standard research practices have come under intense scrutiny, and various changes have been suggested to improve them. The burgeoning field of metascience seeks to use standard quantitative data-gathering and modeling techniques to understand the reasons for inefficiency, to assess the likely effects of suggested changes, and ultimately to tell psychologists how to do better science. We review the pros and cons of suggested changes, highlighting the many complex research trade-offs that must be addressed to identify better methods.},

Additionally, many effects of interest are interaction effects—that is, the effect of one independent variable is contingent on the level of another independent variable. The proper way to estimate, interpret, and present these two types of effects individually are well known. However, many analyses that combine these two—that is, tests of interaction when the effects of interest are nonlinear—are not properly interpreted or tested. The consequences of approaching nonlinear interaction effects the way one would approach a linear interaction effect are severe and can often result in incorrect conclusions. I cover both nonlinear effects in the context of linear regression, and—most thoroughly—nonlinear effects in models for categorical outcomes (focusing on binary logit/probit). My goal in this article is to synthesize an evolving methodological literature and to provide straightforward advice and techniques to estimate, interpret, and present nonlinear interaction effects.},

This allows us to consider properties of methods, such as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analyzed, and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting, and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods, and performance measures (“ADEMP”); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from Volume 34 of Statistics in Medicine, which included at least one simulation study and identify areas for improvement.},

These multisample comparisons are related to the results of Bjerve \& Doksum (1978) who use the shift functions to generalize linear model contrasts to general situations. Some extensions of these results are also obtained. We also study the asymptotic behavior of the "reference" population in multisample Q-Q plots and introduce some new goodness-of-fit statistics.},

It allows covariates to affect both the within-subject variance and the between-subject variance (i.e., the intercept variance) beyond their influence on the means. Typically, the model is applied to two-level data (e.g., the repeated measurements of persons), although researchers are often faced with three-level data (e.g., the repeated measurements of persons within specific situations). Here, we describe an extension of the two-level mixed-effects location scale model to such three-level data. Furthermore, we show how the suggested model can be estimated with Bayesian software, and we present the results of a small simulation study that was conducted to investigate the statistical properties of the suggested approach. Finally, we illustrate the approach by presenting an example from a psychological study that employed ecological momentary assessment.},

If findings are not replicable, then prediction and theory development are stifled. If findings are replicable, then interrogation of their meaning and validity can advance knowledge. Assessing replicability can be productive for generating and testing hypotheses by actively confronting current understandings to identify weaknesses and spur innovation. For psychology, the 2010s might be characterized as a decade of active confrontation. Systematic and multi-site replication projects assessed current understandings and observed surprising failures to replicate many published findings. Replication efforts highlighted sociocultural challenges such as disincentives to conduct replications and a tendency to frame replication as a personal attack rather than a healthy scientific practice, and they raised awareness that replication contributes to self-correction. Nevertheless, innovation in doing and understanding replication and its cousins, reproducibility and robustness, has positioned psychology to improve research practices and accelerate progress.},

Diagnoses of the causes of this “replication crisis,” and recommendations to address it, have nearly exclusively focused on methods of data collection, analysis, and reporting. We argue that a further cause of poor replicability is the often weak logical link between theories and their empirical tests. We propose a distinction between discovery-oriented and theory-testing research. In discovery-oriented research, theories do not strongly imply hypotheses by which they can be tested, but rather define a search space for the discovery of effects that would support them. Failures to find these effects do not question the theory. This endeavor necessarily engenders a high risk of Type I errors—that is, publication of findings that will not replicate. Theory-testing research, by contrast, relies on theories that strongly imply hypotheses, such that disconfirmation of the hypothesis provides evidence against the theory. Theory-testing research engenders a smaller risk of Type I errors. A strong link between theories and hypotheses is best achieved by formalizing theories as computational models. We critically revisit recommendations for addressing the “replication crisis,” including the proposal to distinguish exploratory from confirmatory research, and the preregistration of hypotheses and analysis plans.},

The degree of variability and the form and structure of variance can be viewed as an independent construct in research, representing underlying processes such as stability, cohesion, agreement, power, subgrouping, or conflict. As illustrated in their discussion, variance can be a meaningful construct in multiple content domains and across levels of analysis. They further proposed that variance as a construct can be viewed in one of four ways: (a) linear variance (amount of variance), (b) nonlinear (optimal) variance, (c) patterned variance (configurations), and (d) clustered variance (subgrouping and ties). Different pressures for homogeneity and variability operate, often simultaneously. Researchers are urged to consider these pressures in a given content domain as a means to point to the most appropriate way to examine variance. Incorporating considerations of variance, beyond mean scores, can open up multiple avenues for future research and provide a means for a more nuanced and deeper understanding of organizational phenomena.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a Bayesian generalized linear multilevel model with a pth-order autoregressive error process to analyze unbalanced binary time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data. The model specification is motivated by the generic TSCS data structure and is intended to handle the associated inefficiency and endogeneity problems. It accommodates heterogeneity across units and between time periods in the form of random intercepts and random-effect coefficients. At the same time, its pth-order autoregressive error process, employed either by itself or in concert with other dynamic methods, adequately corrects serial correlation and improves statistical inference and forecasting. With a stationarity restriction on the error process, the model can also be used as a residual-based cointegration test on discrete TSCS data. This is especially valuable because cointegration testing on discrete TSCS data is methodologically challenging and rarely conducted in practice. To handle the estimation difficulties, I developed an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm by orthogonalizing the error term with the Cholesky decomposition and adding an auxiliary variable. The parameter expansion method, that is, partial group move—multigrid Monte Carlo updating (PGM-MGMC), is employed to further improve MCMC mixing and speed up convergence. The paper also provides a computational scheme to approximate the Bayes's factor for the purposes of serial correlation diagnostics, lag order determination, and variable selection. Simulated and empirical examples are used to assess the model and techniques.},

Geht man doch in den meisten Varianten der Individualisierungstheorie davon aus, dass gesellschaftlich bestimmte Normen an genereller Bindekraft für den Einzelnen verlieren und nur aufgrund einer rein individuellen Akzeptanz der Person noch Bedeutung für das Leben besitzen. Diese Entwicklung würde — angelehnt an das Denken einiger Klassiker der Soziologie (hier sei nur Durkheim genannt) beachtliche Konsequenzen für die Integrationsfähigkeit einer Gesellschaft nach sich ziehen. Folgt man z.B. Volker Schmidt (1999: 66), der davon ausgeht, „dass das soziale Band, was die Gesellschaft im Innersten zusammenhält, durch Moral geknüpft ist“, so würde ein Zerfall, ja eine kulturelle Auflösung der Gesellschaft die Folge eines Verschwindens moralischer Prägekraft sein. Doch trifft es wirklich zu, dass Moral im Rahmen dieser scheinbar unaufhaltbaren Modernisierungsprozesse bedeutungslos für die gesellschaftliche Ordnung wird, oder vollzieht sich nur ein Wandel der Form und vor allem der Begründung von Moral, wie es andere Autoren betonen (Nunner-Winkler 2000: 299ff)?},

  abstract = {Problem statement: The problem of heteroscedasticity occurs in regression analysis for many practical reasons. It is now evident that the heteroscedastic problem affects both the estimation and test procedure of regression analysis, so it is really important to be able to detect this problem for possible remedy. The existence of a few extreme or unusual observations that we often call outliers is a very common feature in data analysis. In this study we have shown how the existence of outliers makes the detection of heteroscedasticity cumbersome. Often outliers occurring in a homoscedastic model make the model heteroscedastic, on the other hand, outliers may distort the diagnostic tools in such a way that we cannot correctly diagnose the heteroscedastic problem in the presence of outliers. Neither of these situations is desirable. Approach: This article introduced a robust test procedure to detect the problem of heteroscedasticity which will be unaffected in the presence of outliers. We have modified one of the most popular and commonly used tests, the Goldfeld-Quandt, by replacing its nonrobust components by robust alternatives. Results: The performance of the newly proposed test is investigated extensively by real data sets and Monte Carlo simulations. The results suggest that the robust version of this test offers substantial improvements over the existing tests. Conclusion/Recommendations: The proposed robust Goldfeld-Quandt test should be employed instead of the existing tests in order to avoid misleading conclusion.},

Available methods for comparing both uncorrected and correlated dispersion estimates are first reviewed, including exact likelihood methods, approximate likelihood methods based on log transformed variances, and robust methods. Use of the log transformation provides reasonably efficient estimation, extends simply to the case of correlated dispersion estimates, and yields scale invariant estimates of dispersion change. However, because standard error estimates are not robust to violations of the normality assumption, a non-normality parameter is introduced which facilitates sensitivity analysis. Relative efficiency is evaluated for estimates of dispersion change based on posttest-only comparisons, “pre-post” change comparisons, and comparisons of residual variances after covariance adjustments. These ideas are illustrated by a reanalysis of data from two experiments assessing the effect of teacher expectancy on pupil IQ.},

The model assumes independent observations of the response variable y given the parameters, the explanatory variables and the values of the random effects. The distribution for the response variable in the GAMLSS can be selected from a very general family of distributions including highly skew or kurtotic continuous and discrete distributions. The systematic part of the model is expanded to allow modelling not only of the mean (or location) but also of the other parameters of the distribution of y, as parametric and/or additive nonparametric (smooth) functions of explanatory variables and/or random-effects terms. Maximum (penalized) likelihood estimation is used to fit the (non)parametric models. A Newton–Raphson or Fisher scoring algorithm is used to maximize the (penalized) likelihood. The additive terms in the model are fitted by using a backfitting algorithm. Censored data are easily incorporated into the framework. Five data sets from different fields of application are analysed to emphasize the generality of the GAMLSS class of models.},

And I write as a race scholar, meaning simply that I believe that race—and racism—affects the sociopolitical conditions in which humans, and scholars, develop their thoughts, feelings, and actions. I believe that it is important for all scholars to have a basic understanding of these conditions, as well as the landmines and pitfalls that define them, as they shape how research is conducted, reviewed, and disseminated. I also believe that to evolve one’s discipline into one that is truly robust and objective, it must first become diverse and self-aware.

  abstract = {Heteroscedasticity refers to a phenomenon where data violate a statistical assumption. This assumption is known as homoscedasticity. When the homoscedasticity assumption is violated, this can lead to increased Type I error rates or decreased statistical power. Because this can adversely affect substantive conclusions, the failure to detect and manage heteroscedasticity could have serious implications for theory, research, and practice. In addition, heteroscedasticity is not uncommon in the behavioral and social sciences. Thus, in the current article, we synthesize extant literature in applied psychology, econometrics, quantitative psychology, and statistics, and we offer recommendations for researchers and practitioners regarding available procedures for detecting heteroscedasticity and mitigating its effects. In addition to discussing the strengths and weaknesses of various procedures and comparing them in terms of existing simulation results, we describe a 3-step data-analytic process for detecting and managing heteroscedasticity: (a) fitting a model based on theory and saving residuals, (b) the analysis of residuals, and (c) statistical inferences (e.g., hypothesis tests and confidence intervals) involving parameter estimates. We also demonstrate this data-analytic process using an illustrative example. Overall, detecting violations of the homoscedasticity assumption and mitigating its biasing effects can strengthen the validity of inferences from behavioral and social science data.

  abstract = {Parametric assumptions for statistical tests include normality and equal variances. Micceri (1989) found that data frequently violate the normality assumption; variances have received less attention. We recorded within-group variances of dependent variables for 455 studies published in leading psychology journals. Sample variances differed, often substantially, suggesting frequent violation of the assumption of equal population variances. Parallel analyses of equal-variance artificial data otherwise matched to the characteristics of the empirical data show that unequal sample variances in the empirical data exceed expectations from normal sampling error and can adversely affect Type I error rates of parametric statistical tests. Variance heterogeneity was unrelated to relative group sizes or total sample size and observed across subdisciplines of psychology in experimental and correlational research. These results underscore the value of examining variances and, when appropriate, using data-analytic methods robust to unequal variances. We provide a standardized index for examining and reporting variance heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study is to answer three research questions on moral attitudes (i.e., attitudes concerning abortion, premarital and extramarital relations, and homosexual relations). Which parental and individual characteristics affect moral attitudes? Do the effects of parental and individual characteristics vary across countries? And, if so, can these effect differences on moral issues be explained by national characteristics? To answer these questions, we use the 1991 ISSP database containing relevant data of 16,604 inhabitants of 15 countries. Hypotheses are tested using multi-level analyses. We find that parental and individual religiosity, as well as individual educational attainment, have strong effects on moral attitudes. However, we observe considerable effect differences across countries, which is a rather new finding. Effects of individual religiosity on moral attitudes appear to be stronger in more religious countries and weaker in more secularized countries. Effects of individual education are stronger in more religiously heterogeneous countries and weaker in more religiously homogeneous countries. Finally, effects of individual education on moral attitudes are weaker in short-standing democracies than in long-standing ones.}

  abstract = {Die bildungssoziologische Literatur verweist häufig auf einen Befund, wonach das Ausmaß sozialer Bildungsungleichheit über den Lebens- oder Bildungsverlauf zunimmt. Hingegen deuten die Studien zu den sogenannten Öffnungsprozessen im Sekundarschulsystem eher darauf hin, dass durch nachgeholte Bildungsabschlüsse das Ausmaß der Ungleichheit tendenziell reduziert wird. Der Beitrag nimmt diese scheinbar widersprüchliche Befundlage zum Anlass, sich mit dem bisherigen Forschungsstand detailliert auseinanderzusetzen. Zudem werden auf Basis der Lebensverlaufsstudie, neueren Längsschnittdaten des Bundesinstituts für Berufsbildung sowie des Nationalen Bildungspanels eigenständige Analysen zur Veränderung sozialer Ungleichheit im Bildungsverlauf durchgeführt. Es zeigt sich, dass eine pauschale Zunahme der Ungleichheit beim Erwerb der Hochschulreife nicht festgestellt werden kann. Vielmehr wird die Bedeutung der konzeptionellen Unterscheidung zwischen der Ungleichheit in den konditionalen Allokationsprozessen bei nachgeholten Abschlüssen einerseits und dem Gesamtbeitrag nachgeholter Abschlüsse zur Veränderung der Ungleichheit in der Bestandsperspektive andererseits veranschaulicht. Während in den Allokationsprozessen stets soziale Selektivitäten zugunsten der privilegierten sozialen Gruppen bestehen, zeigen sich für das gesamte Ausmaß der Ungleichheit lediglich für Mitte der 1960er- bis Mitte der 1970er-Jahre geborene Kohorten zunehmende Trends über den Bildungsverlauf, für andere Kohorten eher konstante oder abnehmende Trends. Diese Trends sind jedoch nicht statistisch signifikant.},

On this basis, an integrated set of hypotheses was generated to relate religiosity to the importance that individuals attribute to 10 basic types of human values across religious groups. Hypotheses were largely confirmed in educated adult samples of Israeli Jews (n = 635), Spanish Roman Catholics (n = 478), Dutch Calvinist Protestants (n = 217), and Greek Orthodox (n = 400). Hypotheses also were largely confirmed in a representative West German sample (n = 1,807) with different measures of religiosity and values. The pattern of correlations was robust across subsamples divided by age, gender, education, and income, and for Lutheran Protestants and Roman Catholics.}

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 93, 431–446] has demonstrated that when people are explicitly asked about the emotions they experience as members of a particular group, their reported emotions converge toward a profile typical for that group. Two studies demonstrate that the same type of convergence occurs when a group identity is made situationally salient through priming, without an explicit request to report group-level emotions. People who identify more strongly with the group converge more, and show more similarity between their group-primed emotions and explicitly reported group-level emotions. This research confirms that activating a social identity produces convergence for emotions as well as for attitudes and behaviors. It also suggests that some previous emotion research may have tapped group rather than individual-level emotions, potentially requiring some reconceptualization.},

Intergroup emotions theory (D. M. Mackie, T. Devos, \& E. R. Smith, 2000; E. R. Smith, 1993) holds that intergroup emotions are experienced by individuals when they identify with a social group, making the group part of the psychological self. What differentiates such group-level emotions from emotions that occur purely at the individual level? The authors argue that 4 key criteria define group-level emotions: Group emotions are distinct from the same person’s individual-level emotions, depend on the person’s degree of group identification, are socially shared within a group, and contribute to regulating intragroup and intergroup attitudes and behavior. Evidence from 2 studies supports all 4 of these predictions and thus points to the meaningfulness, coherence, and functionality of group-level emotions.},

It is shown how the convenient structure of generalized linear models can be carried over to this more general setting by considering the mean and dispersion structure separately. Mean and dispersion submodels are formulated for this, the dependent variable for the dispersion submodel being the deviance components of the mean submodel. The fact that both submodels are essentially generalized linear models themselves is used to derive simple expressions for the likelihood equations and for asymptotic tests. Estimation algorithms are proposed which have good convergence properties. The results apply mainly to the normal, inverse Gaussian and gamma distributions but can be extended to discrete distributions by using quasi-likelihoods. The methods developed are applied to a well-known data set.},

Estimation of the dispersion parameters is based on a χ 21approximation to the unit deviances, and the accuracy of the saddle-point approximation which underlies this is discussed. Approximate REML methods are developed for estimation of the dispersion. The approximate REML methods can be implemented with very little added complication in a generalized linear model setting by adjusting the working vector and working weights. S-Plus functions for double generalized linear models are described. Through two data examples it is shown that the approximate REML methods are more robust than maximum likelihood, in the sense of being less sensitive to perturbations in the mean model.

In this paper the location and scale parameters of the t distribution are allowed to depend on covariates. The closed form of the likelihood allows inference to proceed in a similar fashion to the Gaussian location and scale model and provides a framework for a simple scoring algorithm to estimate the parameters. The algorithm includes a procedure to estimate the degrees of freedom parameter of the t distribution. Homogeneity and asymptotic tests are discussed and a methodology is derived to detect heteroscedasticity when the response is t distributed. Simulations reveal considerable bias in the estimates of the degrees of freedom parameter and only minor bias in the estimated fixed effects associated with the scale parameter. In comparison, the estimated location effects are well behaved. To illustrate the joint modelling of location and scale parameters of the t distribution the methodology is applied to two data sets.},

  abstract = {A norm-referenced score expresses the position of an individual test taker in the reference population, thereby enabling a proper interpretation of the test score. Such normed scores are derived from test scores obtained from a sample of the reference population. Typically, multiple reference populations exist for a test, namely when the norm-referenced scores depend on individual characteristic(s), as age (and sex). To derive normed scores, regression-based norming has gained large popularity. The advantages of this method over traditional norming are its flexible nature, yielding potentially more realistic norms, and its efficiency, requiring potentially smaller sample sizes to achieve the same precision. In this tutorial, we introduce the reader to regression-based norming, using the generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS). This approach has been useful in norm estimation of various psychological tests. We discuss the rationale of regression-based norming, theoretical properties of GAMLSS and their relationships to other regression-based norming models. Based on 6 steps, we describe how to: (a) design a normative study to gather proper normative sample data; (b) select a proper GAMLSS model for an empirical scale; (c) derive the desired normed scores for the scale from the fitted model, including those for a composite scale; and (d) visualize the results to achieve insight into the properties of the scale. Following these steps yields regression-based norms with GAMLSS for a psychological test, as we illustrate with normative data of the intelligence test IDS-2. The complete R code and data set is provided as online supplemental material. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {This article investigates hypotheses generated by the veto players' theory. The fundamental insight of this theory is that an increase in the number of veto players (for all practical purposes, in parliamentary systems the number of parties in government) and their ideological distance from one another will reduce the ability of both government and parliament to produce significant laws. In addition, the number of significant laws increases with the duration of a government and with an increase in the ideological difference between current and previous government. These propositions are tested with legislative data (both laws and government decrees) on working time and working conditions identified in two legislative sources: the NATLEX computerized database in Geneva (produced by the International Labour organization) and Blanpain's               International Encyclopedia for Labour Law and Industrial Relations.               The data cover fifteen West European countries for the period 1981–91. The evidence corroborates the proposed hypotheses.},

  abstract = {This study examined whether cultural values predict individuals' moral attitudes. The main objective was to shed light on the moral universalism and relativism debate by showing that the answer depends on the moral issues studied. Using items from the Morally Debatable Behaviours Scale (MDBS) fielded in the World Value Survey (WVS), we found that moral issues can be differentiated cross-culturally into attitudes towards (1) dishonest–illegal and (2) personal–sexual issues. Drawing upon evolutionary and cultural theories, we expected that the former moral domain is not related to cultural values, whereas the latter is influenced by cultural conceptions of the self (i.e. independent versus interdependent selves). We used multilevel modelling with Schwartz' cultural values as the independent variables and the two moral domains as assessed through the MDBS as dependent variables to test our hypothesis. After controlling for individual-level differences in moral attitudes as well as the socio-economic development of countries, our findings confirmed that attitudes towards dishonest–illegal issues were not related to cultural values whereas attitudes towards personal–sexual issues were predicted by the Autonomy–Embeddedness value dimension. We conclude that our study sheds not only light on the universalism and relativism debate, but also on the discriminant validity of cultural values. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {S is a powerful environment for the statistical and graphical analysis of data. It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas that have been made possible by the widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S environments to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S and a course in modern statistical methods. Implementations of S are available commercially in S-PLUS(R) workstations and as the Open Source R for a wide range of computer systems. The aim of this book is to show how to use S as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book is intended for would-be users of S-PLUS or R and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state of the art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis, pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing and bootstrapping are used where appropriate. This fourth edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 6.0 or R 1.5.0 or later. A substantial change from the third edition is updating for the current versions of S-PLUS and adding coverage of R. The introductory material has been rewritten to emphasis the import, export and manipulation of data. Increased computational power allows even more computer-intensive methods to be used, and methods such as GLMMs,},

  abstract = {Heterogeneity is commonplace in meta-analysis. When heterogeneity is found, researchers often aim to identify predictors that account for at least part of such heterogeneity by using mixed-effects meta-regression models. Another potentially relevant goal is to focus on the amount of heterogeneity as a function of one or more predictors, but this cannot be examined with standard random- and mixed-effects models, which assume a constant (i.e., homoscedastic) value for the heterogeneity variance component across studies. In this paper, we describe a location-scale model for meta-analysis as an extension of the standard random- and mixed-effects models that not only allows an examination of whether predictors are related to the size of the outcomes (i.e., their location), but also the amount of heterogeneity (i.e., their scale). We present estimation methods for such a location-scale model through maximum and restricted maximum likelihood approaches, as well as methods for inference and suggestions for visualization. We also provide an implementation via the metafor package for R that makes this model readily available to researchers. Location-scale models can provide a useful tool to researchers interested in heterogeneity in meta-analysis, with the potential to enhance the scope of research questions in the field of evidence synthesis.},

Yet, assumptions of common measures of dependence can fail or estimating such dependence is computationally intensive. This article presents the copula method for modeling the joint distribution of two random variables, including descriptions of the method, the most common copula distributions, and the nonparametric measures of association derived from the models. Copula models, which are estimated by standard maximum likelihood techniques, make no assumption about the form of the marginal distributions, allowing consideration of a variety of models and distributions in the margins and various shapes for the joint distribution. The modeling procedure is demonstrated via a simulated example of spousal mortality and empirical examples of (1) the association between unemployment and suicide rates with time series models and (2) the dependence between a count variable (days drinking alcohol) and a skewed, continuous variable (grade point average) while controlling for predictors of each using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997. Other uses for copulas in sociology are also described.},

Our results aligned with statistical power theory, in that, greater power was observed for designs with more individuals, more repeated occasions, greater proportions of variance available to be explained, and larger effect sizes. In addition, our results indicated that Type I error rates were acceptable in situations when individual differences in intra-individual variability were not initially detectable as well as when the scale-model individual-level predictor explained all initially detectable individual differences in intra-individual variability.

  abstract = {Election forecasts have traditionally been based on representative polls, in which randomly sampled individuals are asked who they intend to vote for. While representative polling has historically proven to be quite effective, it comes at considerable costs of time and money. Moreover, as response rates have declined over the past several decades, the statistical benefits of representative sampling have diminished. In this paper, we show that, with proper statistical adjustment, non-representative polls can be used to generate accurate election forecasts, and that this can often be achieved faster and at a lesser expense than traditional survey methods. We demonstrate this approach by creating forecasts from a novel and highly non-representative survey dataset: a series of daily voter intention polls for the 2012 presidential election conducted on the Xbox gaming platform. After adjusting the Xbox responses via multilevel regression and poststratification, we obtain estimates which are in line with the forecasts from leading poll analysts, which were based on aggregating hundreds of traditional polls conducted during the election cycle. We conclude by arguing that non-representative polling shows promise not only for election forecasting, but also for measuring public opinion on a broad range of social, economic and cultural issues.},

The idea is to fit the marginal quantile regression on each predictor one at a time, and then to base the test on the t-statistics that are associated with the most predictive predictors. A resampling method is devised to calibrate this test statistic, which has non-regular limiting behaviour due to the selection of the most predictive variables. Asymptotic validity of the procedure is established in a general quantile regression setting in which the marginal quantile regression models can be misspecified. Even though a fixed dimension is assumed to derive the asymptotic results, the test proposed is applicable and computationally feasible for large dimensional predictors. The method is more flexible than existing marginal screening test methods based on mean regression and has the added advantage of being robust against outliers in the response. The approach is illustrated by using an application to a human immunodeficiency virus drug resistance data set.},

A variety of methods are available for exploring HTE, each associated with unique strengths and limitations. This paper reviews a selected set of methodological approaches to understanding HTE, focusing largely but not exclusively on their uses with randomized trial data. It is oriented for the “intermediate” outcomes researcher, who may already be familiar with some methods, but would value a systematic overview of both more and less familiar methods with attention to when and why they may be used. Drawing from the biomedical, statistical, epidemiological and econometrics literature, we describe the steps involved in choosing an HTE approach, focusing on whether the intent of the analysis is for exploratory, initial testing, or confirmatory testing purposes. We also map HTE methodological approaches to data considerations as well as the strengths and limitations of each approach. Methods reviewed include formal subgroup analysis, meta-analysis and meta-regression, various types of predictive risk modeling including classification and regression tree analysis, series of n-of-1 trials, latent growth and growth mixture models, quantile regression, and selected non-parametric methods. In addition to an overview of each HTE method, examples and references are provided for further reading.},

  abstract = {Efforts to increase replication rates in psychology generally consist of recommended improvements to methodology, such as increasing sample sizes to increase power or using a lower alpha level. However, little attention has been paid to how the prior odds ( R) that a tested effect is true can affect the probability that a significant result will be replicable. The lower R is, the less likely a published result will be replicable even if power is high. It follows that if R is lower in one set of studies than in another, then all else being equal, published results will be less replicable in the set with lower R. We illustrate this point by presenting an analysis of data from the social-psychology and cognitive-psychology studies that were included in the Open Science Collaboration’s (2015) replication project. We found that R was lower for the social-psychology studies than for the cognitive-psychology studies, which might explain why the rate of successful replications differed between these two sets of studies. This difference in replication rates may reflect the degree to which scientists in the two fields value risky but potentially groundbreaking (i.e., low- R) research. Critically, high- R research is not inherently better or worse than low- R research for advancing knowledge. However, if they wish to achieve replication rates comparable to those of high- R fields (a judgment call), researchers in low- R fields would need to use an especially low alpha level, conduct experiments that have especially high power, or both.},

  abstract = {This paper begins by clarifying that propensity-score weighting in the DiNardo-Fortin-Lemieux (DFL) decomposition analysis—unlike propensity-score weighting in Rubin’s causal model, in which confounding covariates can be endogenous—may generate biased estimates for the decomposition of inequality into “direct” and “indirect” components when intervening variables are endogenous. The paper also clarifies that the Blinder-Oaxaca method confounds the modeling of two distinct counterfactual situations: one in which the covariate effects of the first group become equal to those of the second group and the other in which the covariate distribution of the second group becomes equal to that of the first group. The paper shows that the DFL method requires a distinct condition to provide an unbiased decomposition of inequality that remains under each counterfactual situation. The paper then introduces a combination of the DFL method with Heckman’s two-step method as a way of testing and eliminating bias in the DFL estimate when some intervening covariates are endogenous. The paper also intends to bring gender and race back to the center of statistical causal analysis. An application focuses on the decomposition of gender inequality in earned income among white-collar regular employees in Japan.},

  abstract = {Although substantive studies on segregation, such as residential or school segregation by race and occupational segregation by gender, are many in sociology, the analytical methodology is almost exclusively focused on measurement issues. The author introduces a set of two statistical models for the decomposition analysis of segregation. These models can be regarded as a tool to analyze whether one dimension of racial or gender inequality is related to another dimension of inequality, because they can assess, for example, the extent to which gender differences in human capital are related to gender segregation in occupation. One of the new models is a simple extension of the DiNardo-Fortin-Lemieux decomposition method of inequality, which implicitly assumes a supply-driven determination of positional status attainment, and another model modifies it to incorporate demand-based macrosocial size constraints on positional status attainment, but both models rely on Rubin’s conception of modeling counterfactual outcomes and inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting on the basis of propensity score. An application focuses on gender segregation in occupation in Japan and leads to a paradoxical result: equalizing human capital and labor supply characteristics between men and women increases, rather than decreases, gender segregation in occupation. Although the underlying behavioral mechanism for gender differences in occupational choice remains to be investigated, the analysis clarifies at least demographically why segregation increases under the counterfactual situation.},

  abstract = {Social science theories often make predictions not only about the mean but also about the variance of the outcome of interest. For instance, comparative political scientists argue that democracies and non-democracies have, on average, the same rate of economic growth, but the former usually has less variance in the rate than the latter. Thus, both the mean and variance of economic performance can be functions of regime types. I review four important methods to model and estimate the error variance or its function: the naive two-stage estimation, variance function regression, joint maximum-likelihood estimation, and quantile regression (plus smoothing) estimation. Using simulated data, I compare the performance of these models when the sample size is small or large, when the variance function misspecification is mild or severe, and when the mean function is misspecified. I then apply these methods in two original studies: 1) How does county leaders’ in-office time affect economic volatility in Chinese counties? 2) How does the pre-WTO economic unpredictability in Chinese municipalities affect foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows after China obtained its WTO membership in 2001?},

  abstract = {Of the commonly used discrete choice models, the probit class allows flexible covariance structures for disturbances but is computationally burdensome for problems with more than a few alternatives. The generalized extreme value (GEV) class, including the widely used logit and nested logit models, has the advantage of computational ease but suffers in general from the restriction of homoscedastic disturbances. This article generalizes the GEV class to allow heteroscedastic disturbances across decision makers as well as across choice alternatives. The resulting models include the heteroscedastic extreme value model as a special case, which is a generalized logit model with heteroscedasticity across choice alternatives. Particular attention is paid to the heteroscedastic logit and nested logit models because of their widespread use in practice. An empirical application reanalyzing data from the 1980 presidential election tests the hypothesis of information-induced heteroscedasticity across voters and finds support for a heteroscedastic logit model that reveals stronger effects of voter information on the turnout decision than suggested by the original standard logit model in Ordeshook and Zeng.},

  abstract = {Two long-standing research problems of interest to sociologists are sources of variations in social inequalities and differential contributions of the temporal dimensions of age, time period, and cohort to variations in social phenomena. Recently, scholars have introduced a model called Variance Function Regression for the study of the former problem, and a model called Hierarchical Age-Period-Cohort regression has been developed for the study of the latter. This article presents an integration of these two models as a means to study the evolution of social inequalities along distinct temporal dimensions. We apply the integrated model to survey data on subjective health status. We find substantial age, period, and cohort effects, as well as gender differences, not only for the conditional mean of self-rated health (i.e., between-group disparities), but also for the variance in this mean (i.e., within-group disparities)—and it is detection of age, period, and cohort variations in the latter disparities that application of the integrated model permits. Net of effects of age and individual-level covariates, in recent decades, cohort differences in conditional means of self-rated health have been less important than period differences that cut across all cohorts. By contrast, cohort differences of variances in these conditional means have dominated period differences. In particular, post-baby boom birth cohorts show significant and increasing levels of within-group disparities. These findings illustrate how the integrated model provides a powerful framework through which to identify and study the evolution of variations in social inequalities across age, period, and cohort temporal dimensions. Accordingly, this model should be broadly applicable to the study of social inequality in many different substantive contexts.},
